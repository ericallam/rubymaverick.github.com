I've wanted to do a [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com) project ever since I backed my friend Doug's first attempt at funding the rest of [his movie](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dougroos/the-sky-has-fallen-a-post-apocalyptic-love-story-i-0) (a deserving project if there was ever one).  Today, because I work with the [best team](http://envylabs.com/team), and because we are lucky enough to work on [something people love](http://www.codeschool.com), I was able to launch a [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eallam/try-ios-iphone-app-development-course) to build a [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com) course to help people learn iPhone Development.
