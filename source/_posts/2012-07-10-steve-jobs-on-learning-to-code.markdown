In the recently released [1995 "Lost Interview"](http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/steve-jobs-the-lost-interview/id536749587) with Steve Jobs, Robert (X?) Cringely asks Steve what kind of things people were using his Apple II's for.  His answer:

Because it teaches you how to think...I view computer science as a liberal art.
