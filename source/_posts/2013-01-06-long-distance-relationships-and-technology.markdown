In late 2007, I was in a relationship that had a couple-month stint at a serious long-distance challenge: London to Orlando (I was in Orlando and she was in London).  The first iPhone had just come out but the app-store was still a little ways off.  When we lived together in Orlando, we texted each other all the time, but SMS texts overseas would have been prohibitively expensive. Fortunately, Twitter DM's allowed us to get around this expense by texting solely through "d username" texts to local numbers, which would route through to Twitter and over to each other's DM inbox[<a href="#fn:1" rel=footnote>1</a>].  We'd also frequently video-chat using Skype, which at the time felt almost like a magic trick.  We emailed a lot, or sent each other Facebook messages, or talked on IM.

Fast forward to today.  A long story brings me back into the same scenario: girlfriend living in London, me in Orlando.  But it's 2013. We both have iPhone's.  We both have Mac's.  We both have iPad Mini's[<a href="#fn:2" rel=footnote>2</a>].

And yet, the technology we use to stay in touch is basically the same.  Instead of Twitter DM's we use iMessage or <a href="http://tenthbit.com/">Pair</a>. We still use Skype or FaceTime. We still email, facebook, or IM.  Yes, all of these things have improved, but only incrementally.  Our basic "communication" tools have stayed the same.  Afterall, there are only so many ways to talk to each other, to see each other: text, voice, video.  There are so many great tools out there for what I like to think of as "Active" communication. These tools are basically created to emulate the experience of going on a date: you sit and talk to each other, one on one.  Even "asynchronous" tools like email or SMS are still just for communicating through words and speach the same way you'd do so on a date.  You say something, I say something, etc.  

But that's not how people who are in close-distance relationships always spend their time.  In fact, I'd argue that except for the first couple of months, the majority of time people in close-distance relationships do something completely different: they experience things together.  They go camping, they watch a movie, they see a play, they hang out with mutual friends, they have sex[<a href="#fn:3" rel=footnote>3</a>], they play games, etc.  I like to think of this as "Passive" communication[<a href="#fn:4" rel=footnote>4</a>]. There is a whole huge swath of experience in close-distance relationships that can never be replicated by technology[<a href="#fn:5" rel=footnote>5</a>], but there are two that have now that we didn't have in 2007: games and netflix.

Part of the "long story" I mentioned above involves a 4 year period when my girlfriend and I were separated (a.k.a. The Dark Ages).  We started talking again online a year ago through Words with Friends.  That progressed to playing Draw Something together.  Draw Something allowed us to kind of "play" with each other and figure out how we felt about each other in a kind of safe way.  Basically just internet flirting, but without the awkwardness of having to write things down or stare at each other. In a completely sincere and irony-free way, I credit these two games with saving me from the Dark Ages and giving me back my awesome girlfriend.

We don't play Words with Friends or Draw Something anymore, but we do play a ton of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8">Letterpress</a>, even when we are together in the same location.
